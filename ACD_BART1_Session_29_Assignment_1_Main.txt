Allen       Test 89     Test 78     Test 89
Borlin      Test 67     Test 56     Test 66
Catlin      Test 78     Test 76     Test 76
Dorsey      Test 56     Test 34     Test 45
Eugene      Test 26     Test 100    Test 99
Finerran    Test 99     Test 98     Test 97

• Using an Excel function, show each student's rounded average in an additional column labeled "Rounded Average"

Answer: Use formula "=ROUND(E2,0)" and then drag it till E8

• If a student's rounded average is above "95", he/she has received "honors" in the class. In an additional column titled "Honors", insert a function that will return 

the word "Yes" if they have received honors, otherwise would return the word "No"

Answer: Use formula "=IF(F2>95, "Yes", "No")" and drag it till F8

• If a student's rounded average is 90 or greater, they receive an "A". Between 80 and 90 is a "B", between 70 and 80 is a "C", between 60 and 70 is a "D", and lower 

than 60 is an "F". Somewhere on your sheet, enter this information in cells. Create an additional column titled "Grade" and insert a nested IF function that returns 

the appropriate grade for each student. Use an absolute cell references in your nested IF function to indicate cut-off points between grades. Hint: You will need to 

place the "cut-off grade" values in cells somewhere on your worksheet.
